### This is an **unofficial** package of Hid Library for the sole purpose of providing support for newer frameworks. The [official repo](https://github.com/mikeobrien/HidLibrary) seems to be in hibernation, [the nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/hidlibrary) has not been updated since 09/2020 and [an issue](https://github.com/mikeobrien/HidLibrary/issues/134) from 02/2022 asking for an update also didn't receive an answer.


### Hid Library
